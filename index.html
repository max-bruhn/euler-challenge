		<h1>Euler Project Challenge</h1>

		<p>On my quest to becoming an expert level JavaScript developer and programmer in general, I took the challenge and will solve one Euler Project problem in JavaScript each morning, for the next 30 days.</p>

		<p>The first problems are easy but it gets harder over time. Check the euler-solutions.js script for my solutions.</p>

<h1>Euler Project Challenge</h1>

<p>On my quest to becoming a better programmer I took the challenge and will solve one Euler Project problem in JavaScript each morning, for as long as my math skills will take me.</p>

<p>The first problems are easy but it gets harder over time. Check the euler-solutions.js script for my solutions.</p>

<p>I am a beginner so don't expect my code to be optimised for speed.</p>
